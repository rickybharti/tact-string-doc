# Strings in TACT

Strings are a key data type in TACT, used for representing and manipulating text in smart contracts on the TON blockchain, with a focus on immutability and efficient handling via `StringBuilder`.

## String Basics

Strings in TACT are represented by the `String` primitive type and are **immutable**. Once a string is created, it cannot be modified directly. Any operation that changes a string will result in the creation of a new string. For efficient concatenation, TACT provides a `StringBuilder` utility.

### String Literals

String literals are created using double quotation marks:

```tact
let greeting: String = "Hello, TON!";
```

### Escape Sequences

You can use the following escape sequences in TACT strings for special characters:

- `\"`: Double quote
- `\\`: Backslash
- `\n`: Newline
- `\r`: Carriage return
- `\t`: Tab
- `\v`: Vertical tab
- `\b`: Backspace
- `\f`: Form feed
- `\u{X}`: Unicode character, where X is a hex value (e.g., `\u{1F600}` for ðŸ˜€).

Example:
```tact
let text: String = "Line 1\nLine 2\tTabbed";
```

## String Operations

### StringBuilder for Concatenation

Since strings are immutable in TACT, for efficient concatenation, you should use **StringBuilder**. This allows you to append multiple strings without creating intermediate immutable strings.

```tact
let builder: StringBuilder = beginString();
builder.append("Hello, ");
builder.append("TON!");
let result: String = builder.toString();
```

- **Chained Concatenation**: You can chain concatenations using the `concat()` method:

   ```tact
   let builder: StringBuilder = beginString()
       .concat("Hello, ")
       .concat("TON!");
   let result: String = builder.toString();
   ```

#### Specialized Builders:
- **beginComment()**: Creates a StringBuilder for a comment string, which adds a specific prefix used for passing comments as message bodies.
- **beginTailString()**: Initializes a StringBuilder for a tail string with a null byte prefix, typically used in standards like NFT or Jetton.

Example:
```tact
let tailBuilder: StringBuilder = beginTailString();
tailBuilder.append("Jetton Example");
```

### Converting Strings to Cells

When working with smart contracts, strings are often used in messages, which are stored as **Cells**. To convert a string to a cell, use the `.asComment()` method:

```tact
let commentCell: Cell = "Hello, TON!".asComment();
```

Alternatively, use a **StringBuilder**:
```tact
let builder: StringBuilder = beginComment();
builder.append("Hello, TON!");
let commentCell: Cell = builder.toCell();
```

### Converting Strings to Slices

Strings can also be converted into a **Slice** for lower-level manipulation:

```tact
let slice: Slice = "Some data".asSlice();
```

This is useful when you need to interact with serialized data in smart contracts. Be cautious as this conversion does not indicate how deep the stringâ€™s bits will go into the cell hierarchy.

### Conversion Between Strings and Other Types

- **Address to String**:
   Convert an `Address` to a string using `.toString()`:

   ```tact
   let address: Address = address("EQCD39VS5jcptHL8vMjEXrzGaRcCVYto7HUn4bpAOg8xqB2N");
   let addressString: String = address.toString();
   ```

- **String to Address**:
   Similarly, convert a `String` back to an `Address`:

   ```tact
   let addressString: String = "EQCD39VS5jcptHL8vMjEXrzGaRcCVYto7HUn4bpAOg8xqB2N";
   let address: Address = address(addressString);
   ```

### Additional Utility Methods

- **fromBase64()**: Decodes a Base64 string and returns a slice. Limited to the first 1023 bits.
   ```tact
   let decoded: Slice = "SGVyZSdzIEpvaG5ueSE=".fromBase64();
   ```

- **Int to String**: Converts an `Int` to a string representation.
   ```tact
   let num: Int = 42;
   let numString: String = num.toString();
   ```

## Strings in Functions and Messages

Strings can be used in function parameters and message handlers:

```tact
fun greet(name: String): String {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

receive(msg: String) {
    self.reply(msg.asComment());
}
```

## Storing Strings in Contract State

Strings can be stored in a contractâ€™s state, but for gas efficiency, itâ€™s important to serialize them. This reduces storage costs, which are crucial on the TON blockchain.

```tact
contract StringStorage {
    text: String;

    init(initialText: String) {
        self.text = initialText;
    }

    receive("update") {
        self.text = "Updated text";
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use StringBuilder**: For efficient concatenation, especially in loops or when dealing with multiple strings, always use `StringBuilder` to minimize gas usage.
2. **Limit String Size**: Strings can quickly consume gas and storage resources. Try to minimize the size and number of strings in smart contracts.
3. **Leverage Literals**: For static values, use string literals to benefit from compile-time optimizations.
4. **Immutability**: Strings are immutable, so modifying strings results in new instances, which can impact performance.

## Limitations

- **Limited String Manipulation**: TACT does not provide built-in functions for advanced string operations like `substring`, `replace`, or `split`. Custom implementations or off-chain processing may be required.
- **Storage Costs**: Storing large amounts of string data in a smart contract can be expensive in terms of gas and storage. Keep string storage to a minimum where possible.

## Conclusion

TACT provides essential support for working with strings, focusing on immutability and efficient manipulation through `StringBuilder`. Keep best practices in mind to avoid gas-heavy operations, and always use efficient methods when dealing with string concatenation and storage.
